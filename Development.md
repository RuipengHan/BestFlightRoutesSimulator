# Project Development

Week One: NOV 16 - NOV 20

Team Contract
Team Goals

Week One: Nov 30 - Dec 4

Adding Traversal class.
1. Download and processed the data. 
2. Define the Vertex file to match given data type and import to the vertex class. 
3. Adding print lines to ensure data is successfully imported without any errors like Null or empty. 
4. Adding data structures like vector and map to hold all possible airlines from one place to another to simplify graphs.
5. Customized the graph class with our customized class type as the kep to the map.
6. Connecting all vertices that has at least one route.

Week One: Nov 5 - Dec 11
1. Set Graph Edge Weight
2. Graph Edge Airlines Initialization.
3. Dijkstra's algorithm and BFS implementation.
4. Dijkstra's algorithm can be done in the constructor in graph.
5. User constraints: Stops (landmark); Specific Lines;
6. User interface implementation.
