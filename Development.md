Week One: Nov 30 - Dec 4

Adding Traversal class.
Download and processed the data. 
Define the Vertex file to match given data type and import to the vertex class. 
Adding print lines to ensure data is successfully imported without any errors like Null or empty. 
Adding data structures like vector and map to hold all possible airlines from one place to another to simplify graphs.
Customized the graph class with our customized class type as the kep to the map.
Connecting all vertices that has at least one route.


Expectations:
1. Graph Edge Weight (James)
2. Graph Edge Airlines Initialization ();
3. Dijkstra's algorithm and BFS implementation.
   Dijkstra's algorithm can be done in the constructor in graph.
4. User constraints: Stops (landmark); Specific Lines;


Output:
1. Print in the console (output all the possible routes)
2. Output a file.
